Data Analysis using R: Why Are Low-Quality Diamonds More Expensive?

First I perform exploratory analysis on the diamonds dataset using R. 
Then performed outlier detection to figure out anomalous values. We build various visualizations. 
Then found answer to  interesting questions like Why are there more diamonds at whole carats and common fractions of carats? Why are there more diamonds slightly to the right of each peak than there are slightly to the left of each peak? Why are there no diamonds bigger than 3 carats? Finally,performed machine learning model building and understand why low quality diamonds are seemingly more expensive.
